![](https://github.com/Kotuon/symmetrical_parakeet/blob/main/symmetrical_parakeet_gif.gif)

## Overview

A small Unreal Engine 5.3 project built to experiment with character movement, animation-driven gameplay, and traversal mechanics. This project focuses on prototyping flight and gliding systems using a custom-built ability framework in C++ and Blueprints.

Itâ€™s part of an ongoing exploration into expressive and physics-aware character controllers, animation syncing, and mobility mechanics in UE5.

## Technologies

* Unreal Engine 5.3
* Visual Studio Code

## Features

* __Custom Ability System:__ A reusable gameplay framework was developed in C++, allowing modular and extensible character abilities.
* __Flight & Gliding Prototypes:__ Initial implementation of directional flight and gliding mechanics inspired by action-platformers.
* __Animation Integration:__ Movement mechanics are driven by animation blueprints, notify events, and blend spaces for fluid transitions.
* __Unreal Best Practices:__ Emphasis on clean, modular Blueprint architecture and readable C++ code structure.
